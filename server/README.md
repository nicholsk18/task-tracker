# Simple API Server

### install npm or yarn

`npm i` or `yarn add`

### run the test server

`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

### Test api is located at

`localhost:3001`

#### keep up with my thoughts

so somewhere in the back end will be api call for session id
based on that session id we will use the schedule and activity id
and return those objs
example:
fetch sessions id 1
look in to activity id 1 and return that object
look in to schedule for id 1 and return that obj
now do we get all sortables before we return schedule or after
and make another api call for all the sortables
